#Learnings
##### (Tesco Github Session - Monday - 14.03.2016)

1. Create & contribute to *issues*
2. Create new *branch*
3. Create files under the branch and commit (and then do a pull request and merge back changes from branch to the master)
   (Q: The msg. says branch is deleted, but the branch is still avaiable from the branch pulldown!!! Wonder why?)
